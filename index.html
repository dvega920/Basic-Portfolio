            <p>
                My name is David Vega and I am 38 years old. I live in Haverhill, MA with my fiance Adam and our dog
                Cooper. I am a Contracts Administrator for an energy company based in Calgary. I am looking to
                supplement my Associate Degree in Information Technology with some web development. I have been
                practicing html, css and javascript for approximately three (3) years.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>My decision to go to a bootcamp was due in part because I needed some consistency with coding. My job is
                very demanding and it is very easy to put practicing aside when there is no real incentive or some level
                of accountability.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>I am currently taking on small personal projects to further develop my skills. I am assisting my sister
                with her website for her small business down in Florida where she is a Licensed Medical Esthetician
                providing skin care products and services in the Apollo Beach area</p>
